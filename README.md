# Notbook-copy-from-one-to-another
This will copy a cell value from Workbook1 and paste it in Workbook2 when a button is pressed. Workbook2 is the active Workbook.
I copy and pasted a bunch of this code and reworked most of the middle to fit my needs.
I just needed a simple code to take a few values from one notbook I selected and paste them in another Notebook.
This code only has one copy statement but it can be replicated to move more than one value.
